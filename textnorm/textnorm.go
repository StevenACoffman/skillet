// Package textnorm folds the differences between two copies of the same words that
// nobody means as differences: a run of whitespace where a line happened to wrap, and
// the typographic characters a book, a plain-text extraction and a Markdown file each
// spell their own way.
//
// It exists because several guards need the same folding and must not disagree about it.
// `quotecheck` compares a quotation against the source it claims to come from, `a2check`
// compares a merged skill's language signals against its sources', and canonizer's
// `verify.Provenance` asks whether a rule's anchor appears in its source; a quotation that
// matched in one and not another would be a defect nobody could explain from the output.
//
// That was not hypothetical, and is why this lives here rather than in exegesis. canonizer
// folded whitespace only, so an anchor copied from a source containing a curly apostrophe
// blocked there while the identical passage passed `quotecheck`. 231 of the 233 corpus
// skills contain typographic characters, so the disagreement was the normal case.
//
// Case is deliberately preserved: a quotation differing only in case is a different
// quotation, and folding it would widen every guard that uses this.
//
// Everything here is pure.
